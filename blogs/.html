    Surprise for my mom’s ladies night with my baked goods!

    I did not intend to bake today because I already planned my day out. When my mom told me that she’s having a ladies’ night tonight and that Anna would be there, I knew she would bring me back a gift. Anna just came back from her NY & London trip, and she was very nice to check out both FAO Toy Store New York and Selfridges London for us for Jellycat plush toys. Unfortunately, the Jellycat Amusables Birthday Cake was still out, but Anna got me the Amuseables Toast!
    
    Yes, I wanted to bake for my mom’s friends! I baked my mom’s favorite Earl Grey pound cake, my signature coffee cookies, and Jellycat Toast shaped cookies especially for Anna! It was really hectic this morning because I had such limited time and then had to rush to school immediately. There’s a Homecoming Football Game, and I had to perform in the PEP Band. 
    
    It’s a blessing that everything turned out smoothly, and my mom helped me package the goods and gave them to her girl friends :) Happy baking always!
